Gittip links for chrome extension
-----------------------

[Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/) is awesome. It makes open-source world better.

But when I want to give a tip to developers helped for me,
finding the developer has gittip account is annoying
and many developers don't has gittip account yet.

this problem discourage gittip usage I think.
So, I made this chrome extension.

Gittip-links show gittip icon(include a link) beside username on
[Github](https://github.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)
if the user has gittip account.

You can download [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oiepnjpngemgpdcfnikcmcgglciegfdm)
